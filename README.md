# Emocore
Emocore adds Siri Shortcuts for State of Mind data on iOS 18, which work like the existing Health Shortcuts. You can add new State of Mind entries (both Momentary Emotions and Daily Moods), including labels (ex. Angry, Content) and associations (ex. Money, Family), and you can fetch existing State of Mind entries by date, kind, or valence.

In the future, I'm thinking of adding:
- Adding and reading PHQ-9 and GAD-7 entries
- Editing samples (this comes with the trade-off and having to delete and re-add the entry, which can screw up your health data)
- Filtering entries by labels and associations
- Adding other missing HealthKit types (ex. Time in Daylight)

If you want Apple to add this functionality natively, [you should submit a Feedback Assistant request](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/). Apple encourage you to link existing issues, so you can quote the feedback ID 'FB13046615' in your request to link it.

## Why the name? Why is the app icon so garish?
I'm a big music fan, and I had the idea of calling a different app Breakcore, after a genre of music that involves sampling and chopping breakbeats really fast. Then I thought it'd be clever to call all of my apps after a 'core' genre.

Emocore (a.k.a. Emotional Hardcore) is a variation of Hardcore Punk that focuses on more emotional and introspective themes. So, the app icon blends some emo aesthetics with some familiar vibes from the Health app. You can [learn more about it and listen to some Emocore on Rate Your Music](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/emocore/).
